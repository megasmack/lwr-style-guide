# smsStyleGuide Changelog

## v1.0.0

### Added
 - Started Changelog file.

### Changed
 - Update copy/paste functionality from colors page. Check if site is being viewed in a published state or not. If not, disable copy/paste functionality. Since we're in an iFrame, it's not possible to copy to the clipboard. Clicking the copy button will select the text so the user can copy it manually. In published state, the copy button will copy the text to the clipboard.

### Fixed
 - Removed dual copy/paste toast message from colors page.
